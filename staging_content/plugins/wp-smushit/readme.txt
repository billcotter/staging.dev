Reduce image file sizes and improve performance using the <a href="http://smush.it/">Smush.it</a> API within WordPress.

== Description ==

Yahoo's excellent <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/">Exceptional Performance series</a> recommends <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#opt_images">optimizing images</a> in several lossless ways:

* stripping meta data from JPEGs
* optimizing JPEG compression
* converting certain GIFs to indexed PNGs
* stripping the un-used colours from indexed images

<a href="http://smush.it/">Smush.it</a> offers an API that performs these optimizations (except for stripping JPEG meta data) automatically, and this plugin seamlessly integrates Smush.it with WordPress.

= How does it work? =
Every image you add to a page or post will be automatically run through Smush.it behind the scenes.  You don&rsquo;t have to do anything different.

= Existing images =
You can also run your existing images through Smush.it via the WordPress `Media Library`.  Click on the `Smush.it now!` link for any image you'd like to smush.

As of version 1.4.0 there is a new, experimental `Bulk Smush.it` feature.  You can find the link under the `Media Library` tab.

= Errors

Sometimes the Smush.it service goes down or is under heavy load. If the plugin has difficulty connecting to Smush.it then automatically smushing is temporarily disabled (currently for 6 hours). You can always re-enable it via the `Media > Settings` screen or manually smush the image from the Media Library.

= NextGEN Gallery =
NextGEN user?  Also download the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-smushit-nextgen-gallery-integration/">WP Smush.it NextGEN Integration</a> plugin.

= Privacy = 
Be sure you&rsquo;re comfortable with Smush.it&rsquo;s privacy policy (found on their <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/smush_it/smush_it-4378.html">FAQ</a>).

= Donate? =

If you're so inclined, I've setup <a href="http://dunae.ca/donate.html">a donation page</a>.
